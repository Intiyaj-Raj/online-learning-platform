<br>

I'll add a responsive mobile navigation menu with a hamburger icon that toggles a mobile menu. I'll update the necessary files to include this functionality.
<br>
I've added a responsive mobile navigation menu with the following features:
<br>

*1.Hamburger Menu Toggle*
<br>
    Appears on screens smaller than 768px
    <br>
    Animated hamburger icon
    <br>
    Smooth open/close transitions
    <br>
    
*2.Mobile Navigation Menu*
<br>
    Slides in from the right
    <br>
    Full-height menu
    <br>
    Vertically stacked navigation links
    <br>
    Login/Signup buttons integrated into the menu
    <br>
    
*3.Overlay Background*
<br>
    Dark overlay when menu is open
    <br>
    Closes menu when clicked
    <br>
    Prevents background scrolling when menu is open
    <br>
    
*4.Improved Mobile Responsiveness*
<br>
    Better spacing for mobile devices
    <br>
    Optimized button layouts
    <br>
    Improved touch targets
    <br>

The mobile navigation is now fully functional and provides a smooth user experience on smaller devices. The menu can be toggled using the hamburger icon, and clicking menu items or the overlay will close the menu.
